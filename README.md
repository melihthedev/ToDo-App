# ToDo-App
This is the one of the most important project I've ever made. Since this is reccommended for everyone who are just started to learn Front-End Development I feel myself a more competent developer. 
This is a simple ToDo Applications which you can add what you want to and after you completed it, it is also shown on the  "Completed Tasks" part.
Feel free to give me any feedbacks and I'll be appreciate it.
